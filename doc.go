/*
Package tui is meant to simplify printing on terminal window by
specifying boxes and adding static or dynamic content to it. These
boxes are called panes and they are defined by vertical or horizontal split.
Terminal window is main pane which can be split into another panes, and these
panes can be split again into next ones, and so on... Just like in another
great tool which is tmux.

Pane size can be defined as a percentage or as number of characters. Pane
content can be dynamic and coming from an attached function (in sample code
below it's called a Widget).

Pane can have a border that can be styled by defining what characters should
be used for it (left side, top-left corner, top bar etc.).

Package tui implementation uses ANSI escape codes and so far has been tested
on MacOSX and Linux. It won't work on Windows (probably Cygwin as well).

Install

Ensure you have your workspace directory created and run the following:

    go get -u github.com/gasiordev/go-tui

Example

See below sample with explanation in comments.

    package main

    import (
        "os"
        "github.com/gasiordev/go-tui"
    )

    // TUI has onDraw event and a function can be attached to it. onDraw is
    // called when TUI is being drawn, eg. when first started or when
    // terminal window is resized.
    // getOnTUIDraw returns a func that will later be attached in main().
    func getOnTUIDraw(n *NTree) func(*tui.TUI) int {
        // It does nothing actually.
        fn := func(c *tui.TUI) int {
            return 0
        }
        return fn
    }

    // TUIPane has onDraw event and a function can be attached to it. onDraw
    // is called when TUI is being drawn, eg. when first started or when
    // terminal window is resized.
    // getOnTUIPaneDraw returns a func that will later be attached in main().
    func getOnTUIPaneDraw(n *NTree, p *tui.TUIPane) func(*tui.TUIPane) int {
        // Func is defined separate in another struct which is called a Widget.
        // This Widget prints out current time. Check the source for more.

        // panes and we have to define size of one of them. If it's the
        // left (vertical) or top (horizontal) one then the value is lower than
        // 0 and if it's right (vertical) or bottom (horizontal) then the value
        // should be highter than 0. It can be a percentage of width/height or
        // number of characters, as it's shown below.
